# Graphviz Scaffolding

## Getting started

0. Edit package.json and 
   change name to your project

1. Install nvm

2. Install node
   ```shell
   nvm install
   ``` 

3. Install dependencies

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
   Build step will run automatically after deps.

4. Run the whole thing. 
   Open http://localhost:9000/ (edit webpack.config.js to alter the port).

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

5. Open `src/app.ts` and make your changes. 
   Webpack will reload the app automatically

Good luck!
